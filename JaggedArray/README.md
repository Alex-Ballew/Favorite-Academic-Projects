# C-JaggedArray #

Jagged Array is an array of arrays of which the member arrays can be of different lengths, producing rows of jagged edges when visualized as output. Not to be confused with its counterpart, the multidimensional array, in which each member array is the same length and thus rectangular when visualized as output. Jagged.c contains a variety of methods inlisting functionality, method to initialize your jagged array, return number of bins, add elements to bins, free jagged (deletes everyting and frees memory), etc...
