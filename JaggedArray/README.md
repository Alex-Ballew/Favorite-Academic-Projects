# C-JaggedArray #

Jagged Array is an array of arrays of which the member arrays can be of different lengths, producing rows of jagged edges when visualized as output. Not to be confused with its counterpart, the multidimensional array, in which each member array is the same length and thus rectangular when visualized as output.

# C-JaggedArray History #

Jagged Array was introduced to me in my Computer Systems I class by professor See-Mong. However, all the code provided is my own.
